Was able to create a table in SQL. when you run application in gitbash, the user will see data packets. 
ex- ID, product name, department name, price, stock quantity. 

Nex the prompt will the user what would they like to buy and how many units. 

You will receive a notification saying great option, the order is now complete, and have a nice day.
